# hosts-tracker
This script compares two files containing HTTP probe results and identifies URLs whose HTTP status codes have changed over time.

ðŸ“¦ Example Workflow:

1. Run initial probe:
```
httpx -l alive_http_services.txt -probe -o probe1.txt
```
2. Wait 1 week (or any desired period)...
3. Run the probe again:
```
httpx -l alive_http_services.txt -probe -o probe2.txt
```
âœ… Usage:

Compare `probe1.txt` and `probe2.txt` to detect status changes:
```
python3 tracker.py
```

ðŸ§¾ Output Format:

```
$ python3 tracker.py

ðŸ”„ Changed statuses:
  http://example.com changed from [FAILED] to [SUCCESS]

ðŸ†• New successful targets:
  http://newtarget.com with current status [SUCCESS]
```

If no changes or new successes are found:

```
$ python3 tracker.py

âœ… No status changes.

ðŸ“­ No new successful targets.
```
