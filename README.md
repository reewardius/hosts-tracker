# hosts-tracker

httpx -l alive_http_services.txt -probe -o probe1.txt
```
2. Wait 1 week (or any desired period)...
3. Run the probe again:
```
httpx -l alive_http_services.txt -probe -o probe2.txt
```
âœ… Usage:

Compare `probe1.txt` and `probe2.txt` to detect status changes:
```
python3 tracker.py
```

ðŸ§¾ Output Format:

```
https://example.com changed from [FAILED] to [SUCCESS]
```
